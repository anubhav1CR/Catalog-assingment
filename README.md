This project implements a simplified version of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm, which allows for the secure sharing of a secret among multiple parties. The code reads polynomial roots from a JSON file, decodes them from their respective bases, and calculates the constant term of the polynomial.

## Overview

The program consists of the following main components:

1. **JSON Parsing**: Reads polynomial roots from a JSON file.
2. **Value Decoding**: Converts values from their specified bases into decimal format.
3. **Constant Term Calculation**: Calculates the constant term \( c \) of the polynomial based on the decoded roots.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are required; the code uses built-in libraries.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

## Usage
1. The json file for both the testcases are already given.
2. Change the filepath of the json files according to the needs

## How to Run the Code
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your code file (e.g., assignment.py) and the data.json file are located.
3. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python assignment.py
The program will read the JSON file, decode the values, and output the secret term ùëê
